# Socket

We started using https://github.com/graarh/golang-socketio
But this is pretty outdated, doesn't have some functionality of latest versions of socket.io (namespaces, auth, latest versions of the protocol)

Currently this is still loosely based on this great and useful upstream repo. We need to separate this out and
make a PR to update that upstream repo.
